# About the Application

This application is designed to perform runway redeclaration for UK commercial airports. Once the application is launched, you will see a form on the left hand side that you need to fill out either by selecting options or typing in values. Some menus have been disabled to ensure that the required information is selected before proceeding. Once all fields are completed, click on the "Perform Calculation" button to calculate the new runway parameters. 

The calculated results will be displayed at the right side of the interface, in the form of table and calculation breakdown. Visualisation will also be displayed in the middle of the interface, with tabs to navigate between the three types of views, namely top-down, side-on and simultaneous views.

Please refer to User Guide for more detailed explanation. Application demo is available here: https://youtu.be/R-0Q2KT8cWA.
